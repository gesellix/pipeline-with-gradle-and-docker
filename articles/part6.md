# pipelines don't end after the deploy on prod

## monitoring

* gathering metrics to discover problems
* automatically report incidents/alerts
* allow the incident manager to see the history of events
* need to silence alerts for planned downtimes (or during a deployment)

## feature toggles

* allow rollouts without showing half-implemented features
* allow gradual visibility of features for beta testers, or for A/B testing
